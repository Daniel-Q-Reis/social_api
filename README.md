# Social Media API

Welcome to the Social Media API, a robust, production-ready backend service built with Go. This project showcases a complete set of features for a modern social media platform, architected with best practices and clean code principles.

## üöÄ Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT (Access and Refresh Tokens).
* **Profile Management**: Full control over user profiles, including profile picture uploads.
* **Social Graph**: Functionality for friendships, including sending, accepting, and rejecting friend requests.
* **Content Creation**: Users can create, edit, and delete posts with different privacy levels (public, friends, only me).
* **News Feed**: A personalized news feed to view posts from friends.
* **Media Management**: Support for photo albums and media uploads.
* **Engagement**: Interactive features like likes and comments on posts and other resources.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project is built upon the principles of **Clean Architecture** to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. The project is organized into the following layers:

* `cmd/api`: The application's entry point, responsible for bootstrapping the server.
* `internal/handlers`: HTTP handlers that manage requests and responses.
* `internal/services`: The core business logic of the application resides here.
* `internal/repositories`: The data access layer, responsible for database interactions.
* `internal/models`: Defines the data structures and domain models.
* `internal/middleware`: Custom HTTP middleware, including authentication.
* `internal/database`: Manages the database connection and setup.
* `internal/utils`: Contains utility functions for configuration, validation, and responses.
* `migrations`: Database schema migrations managed by Goose.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Go (version 1.24 or later)
* Docker and Docker Compose
* [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) for database migrations

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/daniel-q-reis/social_api.git](https://github.com/daniel-q-reis/social_api.git)
    cd social_api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Run with Docker (Recommended):**
    The easiest way to get started is by using Docker Compose, which will set up the database and run the application.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

4.  **Running Locally (Without Docker):**
    If you prefer to run the application and database manually:

    * **Start the PostgreSQL database:** You can use Docker to easily spin up a Postgres instance.
        ```bash
        docker run --name social-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=social_api -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:13
        ```

    * **Run database migrations:** This project uses Goose for managing database schema.
        ```bash
        # Install Goose if you haven't already
        go install [github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest](https://github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest)

        # Run migrations
        goose -dir migrations postgres "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/social_api?sslmode=disable" up
        ```

    * **Run the application:**
        ```bash
        go run cmd/api/main.go
        ```

## üß™ Testing and Linting

### Running Tests

* **Unit Tests:**
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```

* **Integration Tests:** These tests require a running database. Ensure the test database is up (e.g., via `docker-compose up -d db`).
    ```bash
    go test -tags=integration ./...
    ```

### Linting

This project uses `golangci-lint` for ensuring code quality.

* **Install linter:**
    ```bash
    go install [github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest)
    ```

* **Run linter:**
    ```bash
    golangci-lint run
    ```
